Description: This package implements maximum likelihood estimation (MLE), maximum a posteriori estimation (MAPE), empirical Bayesian fitting, and full hierarchical sampling algorithms for data models handling various discrete group-conditional distributions.  Supported data types are binomially distributed data, with beta conjugate prior setups; negative-binomially distributed data, with beta conjugate prior setups; and Poisson distributed data, with gamma prior setups.  Options are available for user-specified hyperparameter values, or fitting them through empirical Bayesian methods.
